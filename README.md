Repository for the Machine Learning course in the Masters program Data Science and Advanced Analytics for the academic year 2024/2025

This project aims to assist the New York Workersâ€™ Compensation Board (WCB) in automating workplace injury claim assessments to enhance efficiency, consistency, and resource allocation. Using a dataset of over 590,000 claims, we applied supervised machine learning, including models like Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost. 

The Random Forest model was chosen for its balanced performance and generalization capability. 

Additionally, an interactive web application was developed using Streamlit to enable real-time predictions based on user input, bridging the gap between machine learning insights and practical decision-making.
